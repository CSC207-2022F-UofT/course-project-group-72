# Project Template

This is a template repository for CSC 207 projects. 
This repository contains starter code for a gradle project.
It also contains workflow documents that give instructions on how to manage your Github repository and how to use Github Projects for efficient collaboration.

## Checklist For Your Project
- [x] Verify the correct settings for your project repository
- [x] Set up Github Projects
- [x] Create the implementation plan using issues and Github Projects
- [x] Create development branches for your features
- [ ] Use pull requests to merge finished features into main branch
- [ ] Conduct code reviews

**If your team has trouble with any of these steps, please ask on Piazza. For example, with how GitHub Classroom works, your team *may* not have permissions to do some of the first few steps, in which case we'll post alternative instructions as needed.**
